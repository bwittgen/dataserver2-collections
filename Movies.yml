    summary: |
      Robert Redford (1936ÔøΩ2025) was a towering figure in American cinemaÔøΩan Academy AwardÔøΩwinning director, beloved
      actor, and a tireless champion of independent film. After early success on stage and television, he became an
      international star with landmark films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, All the PresidentÔøΩs Men,
      and The Natural. As a director, he earned the Oscar for Ordinary People and continued to make thoughtful, humanist
      films across decades.

      Beyond his own filmography, Redford reshaped HollywoodÔøΩs ecosystem by founding the Sundance Institute (1981),
      nurturing generations of independent storytellers and elevating the Sundance Film Festival into the worldÔøΩs premier
      showcase for indie cinema. His advocacy for artists and the environment helped broaden the industryÔøΩs horizons and
      create lasting opportunities for new voices.

      Born in Santa Monica, California, Redford was also a dedicated family man and lifelong environmental advocate. He
      married historian Lola Van Wagenen (1958ÔøΩ1985) and later artist Sibylle Szaggars (m. 2009). He is survived by his
      family and a creative legacy that continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences around the world.
