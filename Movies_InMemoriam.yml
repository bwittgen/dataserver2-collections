    summary: |
      Diane Keaton (1946-2025) captivated audiences for over five decades with her singular blend of wit, vulnerability, and fearless style. Born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, she trained at the Neighborhood Playhouse, broke through on Broadway in Hair, and became a cinematic force when Annie Hall earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her range shone in collaborations with Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen, and Nancy Meyers, charting a career that moved gracefully between drama, comedy, and romance.
      
      Keaton championed complex, fully realized women on screen, leaving indelible marks in films like The Godfather trilogy, Reds, Baby Boom, and Something's Gotta Give. She also stepped behind the camera, directing the documentary Heaven and the feature Unstrung Heroes, while producing and mentoring new voices who valued authenticity and emotional intelligence. Her distinctive presence extended beyond film into best-selling memoirs and photographic essays that celebrated creativity at every stage of life.
      
      Away from the spotlight, Keaton was a devoted mother to her adopted children Dexter and Duke, a passionate advocate for historic preservation, and a generous supporter of women's healthcare initiatives. She leaves behind a legacy of bold artistic choices, gentle humor, and a reminder that reinvention can be a lifelong pursuit. Her spirit endures in the stories she told, the homes she saved, and the generations of artists she inspired.

    summary: |
      Robert Redford (1936-2025) was a towering figure in American cinema, an Academy Award-winning director, beloved actor, and tireless champion of independent film. After early success on stage and television, he became an international star with landmark films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, All the President's Men, and The Natural. As a director, he earned the Oscar for Ordinary People and continued to make thoughtful, humanist films across decades.
      
      Beyond his own filmography, Redford reshaped Hollywood's ecosystem by founding the Sundance Institute (1981), nurturing generations of independent storytellers and elevating the Sundance Film Festival into the world's premier showcase for indie cinema. His advocacy for artists and the environment helped broaden the industry's horizons and create lasting opportunities for new voices.
      
      Born in Santa Monica, California, Redford was also a dedicated family man and lifelong environmental advocate. He married historian Lola Van Wagenen (1958-1985) and later artist Sibylle Szaggars (m. 2009). He is survived by his family and a creative legacy that continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences around the world.
